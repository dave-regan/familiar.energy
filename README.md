# familiar.energy

Familiar.energy is a collection of ideas and events with versatile shapes: great metaphors that people have already shared, for example; or weirdly congruent, adjacent, and uncanny concepts that feel like metaphors waiting to be made.

## How it works

1. [reading-list-sync](https://github.com/dave-regan/reading-list-sync) runs on script.google.com at midnight every night, caching my reading list as a JSON file
2. [Jekyll deploy action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action) runs shortly after, executing a build using [Jekyll Get JSON](https://github.com/brockfanning/jekyll-get-json) to output the site.
